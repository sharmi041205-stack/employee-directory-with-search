# employee-directory-with-search
This project is a simple and responsive Employee Directory web application built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to view a list of employees and filter them in real-time using a search bar. The search functionality supports queries by name, department, or role, offering a quick and intuitive way to locate employee information. Each employee is displayed on a styled card that shows their name, department, role, email, and contact number. The layout is responsive and uses a clean grid system to ensure proper display across devices. This project is ideal for practicing front-end development fundamentals such as dynamic DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic styling. It was created as part of a front-end project to demonstrate how JavaScript can be used to build interactive and user-friendly UI components without relying on external libraries or frameworks.
